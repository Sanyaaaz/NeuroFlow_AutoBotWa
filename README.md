**Tech Stack**

Next.js

Tailwind CSS

Vercel v0 (for UI generation and layout scaffolding)

Vercel v0 Usage Notes (5 to 10 lines)

Vercel v0 was used to generate the initial UI layout for the Hero section, Features section, and Testimonials design. The base structure and component styles were scaffolded through v0 prompts to ensure visual consistency and modern styling. Typography, spacing presets, and responsive breakpoints were adapted from the autogenerated components. The Pricing section and Footer also take inspiration from v0 generated patterns. After generation, all code was manually cleaned, refactored, and componentized to align with the final project structure.

**Follow Up Prompt Used for Vercel v0
**Add a responsive Navbar to the existing NeuroFlowOS layout with links to Home, About, Features, Contact, and Pricing. All links should navigate to their respective pages. Add fully responsive page designs for About, Features, Contact, and Pricing using the same visual style as the landing page. Ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness across all components. Improve spacing, typography scale, and section contrast for a polished look.

**Final Notes**

The UI has been built with clarity and consistency in mind. All pages follow the same design language and spacing system. Component level organization ensures clean code and ease of extension for future features.
